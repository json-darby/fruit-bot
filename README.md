# Ferb, the friendly fruit bot
Ferb is a conversational chatbot designed to act as a fruit "expert". Users can interact with Ferb through a graphical interface, 
asking questions about fruit, playing a game, and even having images of fruit classified.

## AI Techniques
Ferb showcases a variety of AI techniques, including:

* **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Uses AIML to define scripted responses, providing conversational abilities.

* **Vectorisation:** Employs TF-IDF cosine similarity for semantic matching, allowing the bot to respond to questions even when the phrasing isn't exact.

* **Logical Reasoning:** Features a knowledge base of fruit facts and uses a logical prover to check the truthfulness and consistency of statements.

* **Fuzzy Logic:** An interactive game uses fuzzy logic to compare the "sweetness" of different fruit scenarios, factoring in ripeness and quantity.

* **Image Classification:** A TensorFlow model classifies single fruit images uploaded by the user.

* **Object Detection:** A cloud-based Roboflow model provides a "second opinion" by detecting and drawing bounding boxes around multiple fruits in an image.
